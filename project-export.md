# DAX Calculations
```dax
// Total Stakeholders
Total Stakeholders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Stakeholder_Data[StakeholderID])

// Average Satisfaction Score
Avg Satisfaction = AVERAGE(Feedback_Scores[SatisfactionScore])

// Average Response Time
Avg Response Time = AVERAGE(Feedback_Scores[ResponseTime_Hours])

// Engagement Frequency (activities per stakeholder)
Engagement Frequency = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(Engagement_Activities),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Engagement_Activities[StakeholderID])
)

// Satisfaction Target Achievement
Satisfaction Achievement = 
VAR CurrentSat = [Avg Satisfaction]
VAR Target = 4.0
RETURN IF(CurrentSat >= Target, "Met", "Not Met")

// Monthly Engagement Trend
Monthly Engagement = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Engagement_Activities),
    DATESMTD(Engagement_Activities[ActivityDate])
)
```
